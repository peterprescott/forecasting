# README

This repo contains the work done for an assignment done for the ENVS801
module *Understanding Data and its Environment* done as part of my [Data
Analysis MSc](https://github.com/peterprescott/data-analysis-msc).

It's probably easiest to see the analysis in [the Jupyter
notebook](nb/draft.ipynb).
